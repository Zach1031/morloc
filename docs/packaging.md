Taking functions, building packages, importing modules. Perhaps the Data
Package model for packaging any data (e.g. put a `datapackage.json` file in
a folder) would work for packaging functions as data. The metadata could
describe the what the language is, perhaps limit the exported functions,
specify dependencies, or whatever else is needed for the particular language.
