# Semantic-oriented programming

Maxim Kizub, an enigmatic Ukrainian, is the dubious founder of semantic
programming. He is the creator of SymADE, a Java-based IDE. He has not written
any papers that I can find. I also cannot find any reference to semantic
programming in literature. It does, however, show up on Wikipedia. The original
author of the Wikipedia page is, surprise, Maxim Kizub.

So far, the only information I have on him is a few scattered comments and bug
reports. There is more information available in Ukrainian.


# Intentional programming

The goal of intentional programming is to encode exactly the intent of the
programmer, rather than the operational details.

It was first developed by the Microsoft programmer Charles Simonyi, who later
left Microsoft to found the company Intentional Software. This company was
subsequently reobsorbed by Microsoft.


# Language-oriented programming

Create a DSL for every problem. Encode specific domain knowledge in a dedicated
language, send it to the user.

MPS - meta programming system (jetbrains).

Morloc is similar in that I want to encode domain knowledge in the language
itself.


# Concept programming

There are a lot of neat ideas written in the wikipedia article on Concept
programming. The goals of concept programming and my goals for Morloc align
well.

See the XL language.
