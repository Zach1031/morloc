There are many programs designed to allow languages to share data and make
calls to foreign languages. I will not talk about any specific cases, but
instead assume the best of these libraries, that they allow data to be passed
between languages faster than Morloc and in a reasonable representation. Indeed
we can imagine a world where all languages are interoperable, data can pass as
quickly between as within languages. In this world, would Morloc be needed?

Morloc offers two things in this world. First a semantic type system that makes
functions searchable across languages. Second, a language agnostic interface to
the other languages. Third, reduction of boilerplate through opinionated
decisions made based on types. ...
