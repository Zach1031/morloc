# Infrastructure

Use the right tool for the right job

 [x] Move from `parsec` to `megaparsec`
 [x] Move to `Text` as my sole string representation
 [x] Use a builder combinator (e.g. wl-pprint-text) for code generation
 [x] Replace ad hoc RDF querying with SPARQL (via hsparql for now)
 [ ] Add graph names and a reliable import system
 [ ] Test for all v0.13.1 functionallity

# RDF representation

 [x] Fix prefix handling

# To catch up with the old C implementation

 [ ] implement good documentation, caching, and effect handling systems
 [ ] add support for python and bash
 [ ] demonstrate parameter handling
 [ ] add higher-order functions
 [ ] implement the constraint system (as assertions)
 [ ] add full type checking

# Documentation

 [ ] Write taxonomy library. Port functions from `taxize` and define types and
     their conversions.

 [ ] Extend README with
     - [ ] A discussion of the architecture (SPARQL, JSON, MorlocIO, etc)
     - [ ] A deeper discussion of the type system
     - [ ] More examples
     - [ ] A contribution and future work section

 [ ] Add haddock for every function
