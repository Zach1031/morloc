# Infrastructure

Use the right tool for the right job

 [x] Write docopt based argument handler
 [ ] Add graph names and a reliable import system
 [ ] Add tests for generated output
 [ ] Remove dependency on local SPARQL server

# RDF representation

 [ ] Unify call representations (remove `binop` and `composition` types)

# To catch up with the old C implementation

 [ ] allow function docstrings
 [ ] allow caching
 [ ] allow effect handling hooks
 [ ] add support for python and bash
 [ ] demonstrate parameter handling
 [ ] add higher-order functions
 [ ] add full type checking

# Beyond C

 [ ] implement constraint system

# Nexus help and usability

 * in the top-level usage printout:
 [ ] print the number of arguments taken by each exported function
 [ ] print the short doc string

 * in the function-specific detailed printout:
 [ ] print the type signature of each exported function
 [ ] print the long doc string

# Documentation

 [ ] Write taxonomy library. Port functions from `taxize` and define types and
     their conversions.

 [ ] Extend README with
     - [ ] A discussion of the architecture (SPARQL, JSON, MorlocIO, etc)
     - [ ] A deeper discussion of the type system
     - [ ] More examples
     - [ ] A contribution and future work section

 [ ] Add haddock for every function
