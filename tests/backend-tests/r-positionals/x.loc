Within a comment, if you want \@ you have to escape it

This program should replicate the following R code:

```
apply(
    replicate(
        n=20,
        sample(letters, size=5, replace=TRUE)
    ),
    2, paste, collapse=""
)
```

I had to redefine the replicate function, to bypass the funky non-standard
evaluation it uses.

@source R

replicate <- function(n, f, ...){
  out <- list() 
  for(i in 1:n){
    out[[i]] = f(...)
  }
  do.call(cbind, out)
}

# @type
# apply     :: [[a]] -> ([a] -> b) -> [b]
# replicate :: (a -> b) -> [b]
# sample    :: [a] -> [a]
# paste     :: [String] -> String

@export
apply

@path
apply . (replicate . 20 `sample` `letters`) 1 `paste`

@lang
* :: R

@arg
replicate := size=5 replace=TRUE
apply     := collapse=""
