@type
foo :: a -> b -> (a, a)
bar :: a -> a
baz :: (c, d) -> [(c,d)]

@path
baz . bar . bad . foo . 1 2

@comment
the following should be a type error:

 baz :: (c, d, e) -> void

since (a,b) !== (a,b,c), the structures are different

but (a,b) == (a,(b,c)), where b == (b,c)

In the above, the following resolved signatures should obtain:
  foo :: A -> B -> (A, B)
  bar :: (A, B) -> (A, B)
  baz :: (A, B) -> [(A, B)]
